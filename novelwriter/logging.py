#  Logging
# =========
#  Standard used for logging levels in novelWriter:
#    CRITICAL  Use for errors that result in termination of the program
#    ERROR     Use when an action fails, but execution continues
#    WARNING   When something unexpected, but non-critical happens
#    INFO      Any useful user information like open, save, exit initiated
#  ----------- SPAM Threshold : Output above should be minimal -----------------
#    DEBUG     Use for descriptions of main program flow
#    VERBOSE   Use for outputting values and program flow details
##
